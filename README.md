## Overview
This is a simple interpreter for the purpose of teaching about programming languages and their interpretation.

This project is intended to be provided in an incomplete state so that finishing the implementation can be a learning activity.

## Setup
 * Install Python 3.10 or newer
 * Install the requirements with pip

## Running the Tests
This repository comes with some tests that can be used to validate the implementation of the interpreter and its components.
To run the tests execute:
```
$ python3 -m pytest imp/test
```

## Extended Exercises
 1. Extend the language so that it supports multiplication and division
 2. Fix the language so that it supports the correct order of operations addition and division.
 3. Extend the language to include more logical and comparison operators.
 4. Extend the language to support parentheses around arithmetic and/or boolean expressions.
